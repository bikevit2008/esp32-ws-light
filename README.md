# esp32-ws-light

# Hello, i publishing my old code
### Espruino, ws2812b leds;
### React.js + Redux client (files) and Server in ESP32.
### Communication between server and client by WebSockets
For minimal size in memory, i used gzip

For working with code you need download files from any server you have. And after use Server.js.
For starting Server.js from bootload search command on Espruino - it can works.


Source for client files probably in https://github.com/bikevit2008/esp-ws-client.
I forgot where i have source.
